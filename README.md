## **Introduction**
This project's aim is to conduct an analysis based on geolocation in order to find the ideal office location for a new gaming company. The potential office location needs to meet the following requirements:

- Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
- Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.
- Account managers need to travel a lot.
- Everyone in the company is between 25 and 40, give them some place to go party.

## **Analysis**
I will focus my analysis in Dublin for the following reasons:
1) Low Taxes:
Thanks to the governmental effort to welcome new businesses and support creation of a more diverse job market, Dublin has the most attractive corporate tax rates in the world – just 12,5 %. R&D expenditure generates a 25% tax credit for offset against corporate taxes in addition to a tax deduction at 12.5% — this means that companies can claim a refund of €37.50 for every €100 worth of R&D expenditure.
2) Talented workforce:
Significantly cheaper than London, Dublin attracts young tech talent from all over the world. Dublin produces over 26 thousand graduates every year and is home to three internationally-ranked universities — Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin and Dublin City University. That’s already a huge talent pool right there. Global Talent Competitiveness Index ranked Dublin among the top 10 cities for attracting and retaining talent.
3) Ireland Help: 
Ireland’s Local Enterprise Office (LEO) spearheads business support for companies looking to relocate to Ireland through mentoring, training and grants ranging from €15,000 to help companies research market demand to €80,000 for expansion.
